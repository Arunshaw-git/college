        <p>Askeladd (アシェラッド Asheraddo?), whose real name is Lucius Artorius Castus (ルキウス・アルトリウス・カストゥス Rukiusu Arutoriusu Kasutusu?), was a Welsh-Danish Viking who commanded a mercenary band of Vikings, which Thorfinn followed for over a decade. He was a major antagonist of the War Arc, due to Thorfinn’s goals.</p>
        <p>Askeladd claimed he was a descendant of the legendary warrior Lucius Artorius Castus through his mother’s side. The latter idolized Artorius's story and named her son after him. The nickname "Askeladd” came from "Ashen Lad," as he was constantly covered in ash from various jobs as a child. </p>
        <p>He was contracted by Floki to assassinate Thors and was afterwards followed for over a decade by a vengeful Thorfinn, who wished to kill his father's killer honourably and begrudginly performed jobs for Askeladd's band in order to earn duels with him. After a majority of his band was wiped out by Thorkell, Askeladd pledged his service to Canute to achieve his secret goal of keeping Wales safe from Viking invasions.</p>
