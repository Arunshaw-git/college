                <p>The father of Thorfinn, Thors is a Jomsviking general whose phenomenal 
                    combat prowess earns him the epithet "The Troll of Jom".
                    Thors grows weary of battle after the birth of his children, 
                    fakes his own death at the Battle of Hjörungavágr, and retires to become a pacifist farmer 
                    after moving his family away in secret. The Jomsvikings later discover that Thors is a live
                    and force him to return to the battlefield.  </p>

                        Askeladd is a cunning, manipulative, and charismatic character.
                        He is a skilled swordsman and fighter, but his greatest strength is his intelligence and ability to adapt and strategize. 
                        He is also able to determine someone's character by looking at their face.</p>
