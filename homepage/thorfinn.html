           <p>Thorfinn Thorsson, also nicknamed Karlsefni, is the main protagonist of Vinland Saga.He is a former warrior of Askeladd's band as well as a former slave on Ketil’s farm who earned his freedom. Afterwards he became a trader and adventurer attempting to settle in Vinland.</p>
           <p> He was born in Iceland as the only son of Helga and the late Thors Snorresson, the most famous Jomsviking warrior until his defection. He is also the younger brother to Ylva and is related to the leadership of the Jomsvikings through his mother, who is daughter of the third Chief, Sigvaldi. </p>
           <p>He spent more than a decade attempting to take revenge on Askeladd, the man who killed his father, even following him into battle to stay close to him, and grew cold and merciless, killing countless people. After he attacked Canute in a moment of shock and rage for killing Askeladd, the death of whom was Thorfinn's goal for most of his life, Thorfinn was enslaved as a punishment. Four years later he gained his freedom and changed his life. </p>
           <p> He vowed to make good of his life and create peace and a land free of slavery in Vinland, which he heard from Leif Ericson’s tales as a child. After leaving Ketil’s farm with a new friend, Einar, he then journeyed to Greece in order to get money to be able to make the trip to Vinland, and after three years he had enough money and people to finally make his journey to Vinland. He created and founded the Arnheid Village on Vinland.  </p>
