        <p>Thors Snorresson (トールズ・スノーレソン Tōruzu Sunōreson?) was a Jomsviking commander whose phenomenal combat skills earned him the moniker "Troll of Jom". He fought for years as a fierce warrior, up until the birth of his daughter. He began to grow tired of the constant battles and decided to surrender his warrior lifestyle, faked his death and settle down in Iceland.</p>
        <p>He was the son of Snorre and the father of Thorfinn and Ylva. Through his marriage to Helga, Thors was the son-in-law of Sigvaldi, the Jomsvikings' third Chief, and was the nephew-in-law of Thorkell.</p>
        <p>Thors was the strongest, bravest, and most well-known warrior throughout the Viking World. He was the only man who could beat Thorkell the Tall in single combat. He used to be a Jomsviking and through only strength of arms and ability in combat he got the rank of captain when he was still 25 years old. Sigvaldi, the commander of the Jomsvikings, Sigvaldi, liked him so much that he agreed for Thors to marry his daughter, Helga.</p>
